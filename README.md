## Features

- **Custom Mode**: Customize the grid size and number of mines to tailor the challenge to your preference.
- **Grid-Based Gameplay**: Uncover tiles while avoiding mines.
- **Timer**: Track your time as you play.
- **Win and Lose Notifications**: Alerts for winning the game or triggering a mine.
- **Flagging**: Mark tiles you suspect contain mines to help strategize.
